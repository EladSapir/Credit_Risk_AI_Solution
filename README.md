# Credit Risk Assessment using KNN and SVM
In this project, we evaluated the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for credit risk assessment using a dataset of 2000 individuals from a German bank. The dataset contains information such as income, age, job etc.

Our results indicate that both KNN and SVM are effective in predicting credit risk, with KNN achieving an accuracy of 90.1857% and SVM achieving an accuracy of 92.5729%.

This project highlights the potential of KNN and SVM for credit risk assessment and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple machine learning algorithms for this task.
