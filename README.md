# Introduction
Welcome to our Github repository for the research project on using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for credit risk assessment using a dataset of almost 2000 individuals from a German bank. The dataset includes information such as income, age, job, duration, porpose etc.

This project has provided us an in-depth understanding of the process of using AI algorithms for credit risk assessment. We have gained knowledge in preprocessing data, selecting and optimizing algorithm parameters, and utilizing various tools and libraries for data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, we have learned about the importance of understanding the performance of the algorithm through the use of evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and ROC curve. Through our studies, we have come to appreciate the significance of data preparation and the need to consider multiple algorithms in order to find the best solution. Overall, this project has provided a solid foundation in the application of AI in credit risk assessment and has enhanced our understanding of the importance and process of using AI in real-world applications.

# Getting Started
To run the code, please follow these steps:

Make sure that you have the database file (.csv) in the same folder as the project.
Run the code. You will see the actual results in the terminal, including the accuracy percentages and confusion matrices for each algorithm. After the calculations are finished, the program will also generate graphs.
In each of the graph windows that opened, you can use the zoom feature to see a better picture. After both of the algorithms graphs, the window of the AUC/ROC graph will also be presented. Note that to see the next graph, you will need to close the previous one.

# Results
Our results show that both KNN and SVM are effective in predicting credit risk, with KNN achieving an accuracy of 90.1857% and SVM achieving an accuracy 92.5729% Overall, our work highlights the potential of KNN and SVM for credit risk assessment and demonstrates the importance of considering multiple machine learning algorithms in this task.


Thank you for visiting our repository. We hope that our research and code will be useful to others in the field of credit risk assessment.
