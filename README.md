#Credit Risk Assessment using KNN and SVM
In this study, we evaluated the use of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for credit risk assessment using a dataset of 2000 individuals from a German bank. The dataset contains information such as income, age, job, and risk.

Our results indicate that both KNN and SVM are effective in predicting credit risk, with KNN achieving an accuracy of 90.1857% and SVM achieving an accuracy of 92.5729%.

This work highlights the potential of KNN and SVM for credit risk assessment and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple machine learning algorithms for this task. The results of this study may have the potential to improve the current loan application process performed by human resources and decrease the mistakes that may happen due to factors such as lack of knowledge, fatigue and others.
